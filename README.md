# Deeplearning_Specialization
This is Deep Learning Specialization course from Coursera 

The foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.

There are five courses where I have already completed first course and waiting for financial aids of the next course)

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Completed)
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (Waiting for financial aids)
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models
